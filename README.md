## Why

Because there is no way to transpose chords to Solfage on Ultimate Guitar so I made a Chrome extention to do it with the press of a button!

This was also a good first project for a Chrome extension. Im welcome to any suggestion to improve the code.

## Installation

You can install it from the Chrome Web Store at this link

[Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ug2-solfege/nnedmefcdcmmeddlhmfbnpbnlmdlecgo)

Or load the folder as an unpacked extenssion if you want to make changes.
