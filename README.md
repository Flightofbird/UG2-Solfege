Chrome extension to transpose guitar chords to Solfege!

## Why

Because there is no way to transpose chords to Solfage on Ultimate Guitar so I made a Chrome extention to do it with the press of a button!

This was also a good first project for a Chrome extension.

## Installation

It still needs a few bug corrections but it works for the most part, you can load it as an unpacked package if you want to use it.

Chrome > chrome://extensions/ > Import UG2_Solfege

Or

In Chrome, click the 3 Dots/Settings > More tools > Extensions. Drag UG2_Solfege.crx into the page that appears.

Pin the extention so you can click the icon while on UG.
